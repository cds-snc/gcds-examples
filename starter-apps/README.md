# Starter Apps

This folder contains example **starter applications** for various frameworks, intended to serve as a foundation when bootstrapping new projects using our design system. 

_Future / Planned_ We hope to eventually integrate these into a CLI tool (`create-starter-app`) to simplify the project setup process.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

Each folder in this directory is a complete starter app for a specific framework or setup:

- `vue/` â€“ Starter app built with Vue 3 + Vite
- `angular/` â€“ *(coming soon)*
- `react/` â€“ *(coming soon)*

Each starter includes:

- Basic layout and routing
- Integration with our design system
- Sample components and usage
- Linting, formatting, and recommended tooling setup
